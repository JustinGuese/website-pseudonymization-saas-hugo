Our API and web interface make it easy for you to scan your data for sensitive information, and our premium version offers enhanced scanning capabilities for a more thorough analysis.\nIn addition to identifying sensitive data, businesses must also take steps to protect it.

With the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018, businesses of all sizes must ensure that they are protecting personal data in a compliant manner.\nOne way to achieve compliance is through the process of pseudonymization and anonymization. Pseudonymization refers to the process of replacing identifying information with a pseudonym, or false name, in order to protect the individual\u0026rsquo;s privacy. Anonymization, on the other hand, refers to the process of completely removing identifying information from data sets.\nWhile both methods can be effective in protecting personal data, the appropriate method will depend on the specific use case and the type of data being collected. For example, in the healthcare industry, it may be necessary to fully anonymize patient data in order to comply with regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\nAt DataFortress.cloud, we offer a range of services to help businesses navigate the complexities of data privacy and compliance. One of our key offerings is our data compliance consultation service. Our team of experts has extensive experience in working with a variety of industries, including automotive, financial, and medical, and can provide guidance on the best practices for protecting personal data.\nOur consultation services include a thorough analysis of your current data landscape, identification of sensitive data, and recommendations for implementing pseudonymization and anonymization methods. We also offer additional services such as secure data hosting, data pipeline transformation and ETL, and on-premise data scanning solutions.\nIn addition, we provide a web interface and API that allows you to easily upload and scan your data for GDPR compliance. The API and web interface allow you to upload files in various formats, including CSV, Excel, and Parquet, and will automatically label sensitive columns.

Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, DataFortress.cloud analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.\nSubscription to our newsletters On the website of DataFortress.cloud, users are given the opportunity to subscribe to our enterprise’s newsletter. The input mask used for this purpose determines what personal data are transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is ordered from the controller. DataFortress.cloud informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a newsletter about enterprise offers. The enterprise’s newsletter may only be received by the data subject if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject registers for the newsletter shipping. A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered by a data subject for the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, in the double opt-in procedure. This confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as the data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.\nDuring the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer system assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the registration. The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal protection of the controller.\nThe personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter. In addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as long as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical circumstances. There will be no transfer of personal data collected by the newsletter service to third parties. The subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the data subject at any time. The consent to the storage of personal data, which the data subject has given for shipping the newsletter, may be revoked at any time. For the purpose of revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found in each newsletter. It is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on the website of the controller, or to communicate this to the controller in a different way.\nNewsletter-Tracking The newsletter of DataFortress.cloud contains so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking pixel, DataFortress.cloud may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by data subjects. Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by the controller in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the data subject. These personal data will not be passed on to third parties. Data subjects are at any time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by means of the double-opt-in procedure. After a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the controller. DataFortress.cloud automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.\nContact possibility via the website The website of DataFortress.cloud contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to our enterprise, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject. There is no transfer of this personal data to third parties.\nComments function in the blog on the website DataFortress.cloud offers users the possibility to leave individual comments on individual blog contributions on a blog, which is on the website of the controller. A blog is a web-based, publicly-accessible portal, through which one or more people called bloggers or web-bloggers may post articles or write down thoughts in so-called blogposts. Blogposts may usually be commented by third parties.\nIf a data subject leaves a comment on the blog published on this website, the comments made by the data subject are also stored and published, as well as information on the date of the commentary and on the user’s (pseudonym) chosen by the data subject. In addition, the IP address assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) to the data subject is also logged. This storage of the IP address takes place for security reasons, and in case the data subject violates the rights of third parties, or posts illegal content through a given comment. The storage of these personal data is, therefore, in the own interest of the data controller, so that he can exculpate in the event of an infringement. This collected personal data will not be passed to third parties, unless such a transfer is required by law or serves the aim of the defense of the data controller.\nSubscription to comments in the blog on the website The comments made in the blog of DataFortress.cloud may be subscribed to by third parties. In particular, there is the possibility that a commenter subscribes to the comments following his comments on a particular blog post. If a data subject decides to subscribe to the option, the controller will send an automatic confirmation e-mail to check the double opt-in procedure as to whether the owner of the specified e-mail address decided in favor of this option. The option to subscribe to comments may be terminated at any time.\nRoutine erasure and blocking of personal data The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to. If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.\nRights of the data subject a) Right of confirmation Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed. If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of confirmation, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. b) Right of access Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller free information about his or her personal data stored at any time and a copy of this information.

Furthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain information as to whether personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation. Where this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.\nIf a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.\nc) Right to rectification Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.\nIf a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.\nd) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten) Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary:\nThe personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed. The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing. The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR. The personal data have been unlawfully processed. The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject. The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of the GDPR. If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request the erasure of personal data stored by DataFortress.cloud, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. An employee of DataFortress.cloud shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.\nWhere the controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as far as processing is not required. An employees of DataFortress.cloud will arrange the necessary measures in individual cases.\ne) Right of restriction of processing Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:\nThe accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data. The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of their use instead. The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject. If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by DataFortress.cloud, he or she may at any time contact any employee of the controller. The employee of DataFortress.cloud will arrange the restriction of the processing.\nf) Right to data portability Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she shall have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.\nFurthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.\nIn order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time contact any employee of DataFortress.cloud.\ng) Right to object Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time, to processing of personal data concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.\nDataFortress.cloud shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\nIf DataFortress.cloud processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If the data subject objects to DataFortress.cloud to the processing for direct marketing purposes, DataFortress.cloud will no longer process the personal data for these purposes.\nIn addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her by DataFortress.cloud for scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.\nIn order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may contact any employee of DataFortress.cloud.

A social network is a place for social meetings on the Internet, an online community, which usually allows users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space. A social network may serve as a platform for the exchange of opinions and experiences, or enable the Internet community to provide personal or business-related information. Facebook allows social network users to include the creation of private profiles, upload photos, and network through friend requests.\nThe operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, United States. If a person lives outside of the United States or Canada, the controller is the Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.\nWith each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet website, which is operated by the controller and into which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-ins) was integrated, the web browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download display of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook through the Facebook component. An overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be accessed under https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/. During the course of this technical procedure, Facebook is made aware of what specific sub-site of our website was visited by the data subject.\nIf the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook, Facebook detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which specific sub-site of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the Facebook component and associated with the respective Facebook account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Facebook buttons integrated into our website, e.g. the “Like” button, or if the data subject submits a comment, then Facebook matches this information with the personal Facebook user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.\nFacebook always receives, through the Facebook component, information about a visit to our website by the data subject, whenever the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook during the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Facebook component or not. If such a transmission of information to Facebook is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Facebook account before a call-up to our website is made.\nThe data protection guideline published by Facebook, which is available at https://facebook.com/about/privacy/, provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook. In addition, it is explained there what setting options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the data subject.

During the course of this technical procedure, Amazon receives personal information that is used to trace the origin of orders from Amazon, and as a result, to allow the accounting of a commission. Among other things, Amazon may understand that the data subject has clicked on an affiliate link on our website.\nThe data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used, and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Amazon from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Amazon may be deleted at anytime via a web browser or other software programs.\nFurther information and the actual data protection provisions of Amazon may be retrieved under https://www.amazon.de/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=3312401\u0026amp;language=en_GB.\nData protection provisions about the application and use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function) On this website, the controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function). Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed. Web analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising. The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.\nFor the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the application “_gat. _anonymizeIp”. By means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.\nThe purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website. Google uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.\nGoogle Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google. During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.\nThe cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject. With each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.\nThe data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.\nIn addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such. For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and install it. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google. If the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.\nFurther information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/ and under http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html. Google Analytics is further explained under the following Link https://www.google.com/analytics/.\nData protection provisions about the application and use of Google-AdWords On this website, the controller has integrated Google AdWords.

In the Google Advertising Network, the ads are distributed on relevant web pages using an automatic algorithm, taking into account the previously defined keywords. The operating company of Google AdWords is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.\nThe purpose of Google AdWords is the promotion of our website by the inclusion of relevant advertising on the websites of third parties and in the search engine results of the search engine Google and an insertion of third-party advertising on our website.\nIf a data subject reaches our website via a Google ad, a conversion cookie is filed on the information technology system of the data subject through Google. The definition of cookies is explained above. A conversion cookie loses its validity after 30 days and is not used to identify the data subject. If the cookie has not expired, the conversion cookie is used to check whether certain sub-pages, e.g, the shopping cart from an online shop system, were called up on our website. Through the conversion cookie, both Google and the controller can understand whether a person who reached an AdWords ad on our website generated sales, that is, executed or canceled a sale of goods.\nThe data and information collected through the use of the conversion cookie is used by Google to create visit statistics for our website. These visit statistics are used in order to determine the total number of users who have been served through AdWords ads to ascertain the success or failure of each AdWords ad and to optimize our AdWords ads in the future. Neither our company nor other Google AdWords advertisers receive information from Google that could identify the data subject.\nThe conversion cookie stores personal information, e.g. the Internet pages visited by the data subject. Each time we visit our Internet pages, personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.\nThe data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as stated above, by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from placing a conversion cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, a cookie set by Google AdWords may be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.\nThe data subject has a possibility of objecting to the interest based advertisement of Google. Therefore, the data subject must access from each of the browsers in use the link www.google.de/settings/ads and set the desired settings.\nFurther information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.\nData protection provisions about the application and use of Instagram On this website, the controller has integrated components of the service Instagram.

This information is collected by YouTube and Google and assigned to the respective YouTube account of the data subject.\nYouTube and Google will receive information through the YouTube component that the data subject has visited our website, if the data subject at the time of the call to our website is logged in on YouTube; this occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on a YouTube video or not. If such a transmission of this information to YouTube and Google is not desirable for the data subject, the delivery may be prevented if the data subject logs off from their own YouTube account before a call-up to our website is made.\nYouTube’s data protection provisions, available at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/, provide information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by YouTube and Google.\nLegal basis for the processing Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).\nThe legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.\nPeriod for which the personal data will be stored The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.\nProvision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.\nExistence of automated decision-making As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.\nThis Privacy Policy has been generated by the Privacy Policy Generator of the DGD – Your External DPO that was developed in cooperation with German Lawyers from WILDE BEUGER SOLMECKE, Cologne.automatic Notification.\n","date":"01","image":null,"permalink":"/es/english/privacy-policy/","tags":null,"title":"Privacy \u0026 Policy"},{"categories":null,"contents":"pseudonymization.de is a product of DataFortress.cloud UG\nGeneral Terms and Conditions of DataFortress.cloud UG Preamble: DataFortress.cloud UG (hereinafter “DataFortress”), Georgenstraße 13, 86152 Augsburg, offers services in the field of web hosting.

The quantitative scope of the services is variable and can be flexibly changed by the Customer (see Section 11 below). The offers of DataFortress are not directed at consumers within the meaning of § 13 BGB (German Civil Code).\n1.2 The contract is concluded by DataFortress accepting the order placed by the customer on the basis of the respective offer of DataFortress by order confirmation by e-mail (hereinafter referred to as “the contract” regardless of singular or plural).\n1.3 These contractual terms and conditions apply exclusively to the contractual relationship between DataFortress and the Customer. General terms and conditions of the Customer shall not apply. Counter-confirmations of the customer with reference to its own terms and conditions are expressly rejected, insofar as such terms and conditions deviate from the present contractual terms or contain provisions that are contrary to them.\n2 Subject matter of the contract 2.1 The subject matter of the contract is the provision of computer capacity, storage space (server hosting) and the making available of data for permanent retrieval from the Internet (web hosting) depending on the individual agreement between the parties in accordance with the annex hosting concept/offer/service certificate. The customer is obligated to accept the minimum quantity regulated in the Annex Hosting Concept/Offer/Service Certificate. In addition, DataFortress offers services that support or supplement the hosting and that the Customer can book separately.\n2.2 Depending on the selected tariff and (optionally) the selected Service Level Agreement (“SLA”), the Customer shall be provided with dedicated or virtualized servers without or with software and various performance features defined in more detail in Annex Hosting Concept/Offer/Service Certificate.\n2.3 The SLA selected by the Customer is to be taken from the appendices of the respective valid Service Level Agreements and product-specific Service Level Agreements, if applicable.\n2.4 The customer shall receive access data to its customer front end, in which it can view how much power it is using. These access data must always be kept secret and may not be made available to third parties. If Customer becomes aware of any unauthorized use of its access data, Customer shall inform DataFortress immediately. The customer is solely responsible for all activities in connection with his access data.\nhosting services 3.1 DataFortress keeps the data stored by the customer in accordance with the contract (in particular his website) permanently, worldwide and basically publicly accessible on the Internet via the network maintained by DataFortress and the Internet connected to it.

For this purpose, DataFortress provides him with appropriate certificates. The certificates are to be kept secret at all times and may not be made available to unauthorized third parties. Furthermore, they are personalized, but a customer may receive several personalized access authorizations upon request in order to allow employees access. The customer will inform DataFortress immediately if third parties have obtained his access data. In individual cases, companies affiliated with the customer are also considered third parties. The customer is solely responsible for all activities in connection with the certificates made available to him.\n3.3 DataFortress enables the client to view the traffic, which is the basis for billing, via the client front end.

The software, the computing power required for its use and the necessary storage and data processing space are provided by DataFortress. The software remains on servers for which DataFortress is responsible. DataFortress is not responsible for establishing and maintaining the data connection between the Customer’s IT system and the aforementioned transfer point.\n4.2 Insofar as the software runs exclusively on the servers of DataFortress or of a service provider commissioned by DataFortress, the Customer does not require any copyright usage rights to the software, nor does DataFortress grant any such rights. However, DataFortress grants the Customer, for the term of the agreement, the non-exclusive, non-transferable right, limited in time to the term of the user agreement, to load the user interface of the software for display on the screen into the main memory of the end devices used for this purpose in accordance with the agreement and to make the resulting reproductions of the user interface.\n4.3 With respect to DataFortress software, the customer acquires the right to access DataFortress software to the extent stipulated in the contract during the term of the contract and to use it for the purposes stipulated in the contract.\n5 Availability 5.1 The availability of the servers, if applicable, the software and the data paths up to the transfer point to the Internet is 99.5% per year less the time required for the installation of updates, upgrades, new releases and/or other modifications, unless otherwise agreed in the appendices to the respective valid Service Level Agreements and product-specific Service Level Agreements.\n5.2 DataFortress draws the Customer’s attention to the fact that restrictions or impairments of the services provided may arise that are beyond DataFortress’ control. This includes, in particular, actions of third parties not acting on behalf of DataFortress, technical conditions of the Internet that cannot be influenced by DataFortress as well as force majeure. Also the hardware and software or technical infrastructure used by the customer can have an influence on the services of DataFortress. Insofar as such circumstances have an influence on the availability or functionality of the service provided by DataFortress, this has no effect on the contractual conformity of the services provided.\n5.3 The Customer is obligated to notify DataFortress immediately and as precisely as possible of any functional failures, malfunctions or impairments. If the Customer fails to do so, § 536 c BGB shall apply accordingly.\n6 Incident Management 6.1 An incident is deemed to exist if servers or software do not fulfill the contractual functions.\n6.2 Notifications of support incidents shall be made via a ticket system, which can also be accessed at info@datafortress.cloud.

The parties agree that DataFortress neither owes a domain search nor the success of the registration procedure. 7.2 DataFortress does not carry out any legal or content-related examination of the domains to be registered. In particular, DataFortress does not assume any examination as to whether and to what extent a registration is actually or legally possible and permissible. The customer has to carry out the corresponding checks himself or have them carried out. The customer is responsible for checking which registration rules apply at the respective registry.\nrights to individual work results Insofar as DataFortress develops individually protectable contents for the customer (for example scripts or certificates), DataFortress grants the customer an exclusive right of use to the order results individually developed and/or provided for the customer (“work results”). DataFortress transfers to the customer the exclusive, content, temporally and spatially unlimited and irrevocable right of use to these work results for all known and unknown types of use, including the right to process the work results in any way. 9 Obligations of the Customer 9.1 The Customer undertakes vis-à-vis DataFortress to perform the acts of cooperation required for the provision of the agreed services. In particular, the customer shall provide all necessary information and documents free of charge and shall designate a contact person who is professionally qualified and has sufficient authorizations for the performance of the contract. Submitted information and documents serve as an essential basis for the implementation services of DataFortress. The provision of incorrect or incomplete information shall be at the Customer’s expense.\n9.2 The Customer shall itself back up data and information, including those processed on IT systems for which DataFortress is responsible. In addition, DataFortress will create daily backups for VEs, which will be kept for seven days, weekly backups, which will be kept for four weeks and monthly backups, which will be kept for three months.

The Customer shall also ensure that data stored on DataFortress’ systems are free of any malware.\n9.4 Insofar as the Customer provides DataFortress with protected content (e.g. graphics, trademarks and other content protected by copyright or trademark law), the Customer shall grant DataFortress all rights necessary for the performance of the contractual agreement. This includes, in particular, the right to make the relevant content available to the public. In this context, the customer assures that he owns all necessary rights to customer materials provided in order to grant DataFortress the corresponding rights.\n9.5 DataFortress shall be released from the obligation to provide the contractual services if and to the extent that the Customer fails to comply with its duties to cooperate. Any existing schedules shall be automatically adjusted accordingly. If the Customer is responsible for the failure to provide the cooperation service and if DataFortress suffers damage as a result, the Customer shall compensate DataFortress for such damage.\nexemption 10.1 As a technical service provider, DataFortress stores content and data for the Customer, which the Customer enters and stores and makes available for retrieval when using the contractual services. The Customer undertakes vis-à-vis DataFortress not to post any content and data that is punishable by law or otherwise illegal in absolute terms or in relation to individual third parties.

DataFortress does not take any notice of contents of the customer and does not check them in any respect.\n10.3 In this context, Customer agrees to indemnify DataFortress against any liability and any costs, including possible and actual costs of legal proceedings, in the event that a claim is made against DataFortress by third parties, including employees of Customer personally, as a result of alleged acts or omissions of Customer. DataFortress shall notify the Customer of the claim and, to the extent legally possible, give the Customer the opportunity to defend the asserted claim. At the same time, the Customer shall immediately provide DataFortress with all information available to it regarding the facts that are the subject of the claim in full.\n10.4 Any further claims for damages shall remain unaffected.\nchanges in the subject matter of the contract (change request procedure) 11.1 Changes in the quantitative scope of the services owed in accordance with the Annex Hosting Concept/Offer/Service Certificate (e.g. with regard to the storage space used, number of CPU cores or amount of RAM as well as the number of systems of a type (e.g. app server, database slave server, etc.) may be made by the Customer himself or have them made by DataFortress at any time.

If DataFortress determines that the change request can be implemented without further ado, the change will be implemented and documented in the ticket system.\n11.4 If DataFortress determines that services to be rendered cannot be performed or can only be performed with a delay due to the expected review effort for the change, DataFortress shall notify the customer of this and point out to the customer that the change request can only be further reviewed if the affected services are postponed accordingly. If the customer declares his agreement with this postponement, DataFortress will carry out the review of the change request. If, on the other hand, the customer withdraws its change request, the initiated change request procedure ends.\n11.5 To the extent that the change request cannot be implemented immediately and without additional consultation with the customer, DataFortress shall, after reviewing the change request, present to the customer the effects of the change request on the agreements made. The explanation shall contain either a proposal for the implementation of the change request or information as to why the change request cannot be implemented. The parties shall immediately agree on the content of a proposal for the implementation of the change request and fix the result of a successful agreement in a supplementary agreement. If no agreement is reached or if the change request procedure ends for any other reason, the original service content and scope shall remain in effect. (Such supplements only exist in exceptional cases. The business is too dynamic for that in many cases).\n11.6 The customer shall bear the expenses incurred as a result of the change request. This includes in particular the expenses for the examination of the change request, the preparation of a change proposal and any downtimes. The applicable hourly rate for this shall be based on the price list valid at the time of the conclusion of the contract.\n11.7 DataFortress is entitled to change or deviate from the scope of its services in order to ensure the provision of its services under this agreement and, in particular, to release larger volumes, even without a previously explicitly issued order by the customer. DataFortress will notify the customer of such changes immediately after they are made. After notification, the customer may reject the changes or deviations or additionally provided services. If the customer does not object to the changes or deviations after corresponding notification by DataFortress within two weeks after receipt of the notification, DataFortress will invoice the services rendered according to the respective valid price list. If the Customer does not object in text form within the aforementioned period, the change, deviation or additionally rendered service shall be deemed approved.\n11.8 If the catalog of services has to be changed due to an act of cooperation not undertaken by the Customer, in particular due to the correction of information already provided up to the time of acceptance or as a result of the subsequent submission of information, this shall be deemed to be a change in services in accordance with this Section 11.\n12 Remuneration; payment and invoicing modalities 12.1 Invoicing shall be based on the volume used or the services booked. Booked resources such as servers as well as agreed flat rates shall be invoiced monthly in advance, services which are invoiced according to consumption, such as traffic, shall be invoiced subsequently. The prices are based on the price list valid at the time of the conclusion of the contract.\n12.2 Unless otherwise indicated, prices quoted by DataFortress are subject to the applicable statutory value-added tax. The remuneration is based on the price list valid at the time of the conclusion of the contract. Additional services which are subject to a charge and which the customer makes use of after conclusion of the contract shall be remunerated in accordance with the price list valid at that time or in accordance with the agreement of the parties.\n12.3 If a fixed price is agreed as a one-time payment, it shall be due for payment without a discount upon receipt of the invoice. If payment of the fixed price in installments is agreed, the agreed installment shall be due for payment upon receipt of the partial invoice without any further discount.\n12.4 If the agreed service is remunerated on a time and material basis, the invoice shall be issued monthly in arrears for the previous month. The invoice shall be issued on the basis of written proof of performance, which shall be attached to the invoice. Services that are billed on a time basis, e.g. in the area of Managed Services, are documented by DataFortress with the smallest unit of 15 minutes. The performance records are considered accepted if the Client does not object to them within a maximum of 5 working days after receipt.\n12.5 In the case of term contracts, DataFortress can adjust the prices as well as the rates for an agreed remuneration according to the general price development after the expiry of the initially agreed contract term. If the fee increase amounts to more than 5%, the customer may terminate the contractual relationship with a notice period of five working days. The notice of termination shall be given within 14 days after the announcement of the increase.\n12.6 In the case of agreed partial services and for partial invoices, the provisions of this Section 12 shall apply accordingly.\n12.7 Invoices shall be sent electronically as PDF files. A fee shall be charged for mailing. Invoices shall be due for payment without deduction immediately upon receipt. The conditions and consequences of default shall be governed by the statutory provisions. If a due payment of a customer is more than three months overdue or has been reminded for the third time, DataFortress reserves the right to discontinue its own services or to block access to the service. If a partial amount of an invoice is disputed, the undisputed part shall always be paid.\n12.8 Both contracting parties are only entitled to set-off with legally established or undisputed claims that are due and such that arise from the same legal relationship and have arisen from a claim that would have entitled the creditor of the counterclaim to assert a right of retention or a right to refuse performance.\n13 Liability 13.1 DataFortress is liable for damages of the Customer caused intentionally or by gross negligence, which are the consequence of the non-existence of a guaranteed quality of the object of performance, which are based on a culpable violation of essential contractual obligations (so-called cardinal obligations, see Section 13.2), which are the consequence of culpable injury to health, body or life or for which liability is provided for under the Product Liability Act, in accordance with the statutory provisions.\n13.2 Cardinal obligations are those contractual obligations the fulfillment of which makes the proper execution of the contract possible in the first place and the observance of which the contractual partner may regularly rely on, and the violation of which on the other hand endangers the achievement of the purpose of the contract.\n13.3 In the event of a breach of a cardinal obligation, liability - insofar as the damage is based solely on simple negligence and does not affect life, limb or health - is limited to such damage that is foreseeable and can typically be expected to occur within the scope of contracts such as those between DataFortress and the Customer.\n13.4 Liability due to interruption, malfunction or other events causing damage, which are based on telecommunication services of DataFortress or third parties for which DataFortress is liable, is limited to the amount of recourse possible for DataFortress against the respective telecommunication service provider. DataFortress is not liable for the operability of the connection lines to the contractual server, in case of power failures and in case of failures of servers which are not within the sphere of influence of DataFortress.\n13.5 Claims for loss of profit are excluded.\n13.6 In all other respects, liability - for whatever legal reason - of DataFortress as well as of its vicarious agents and assistants is excluded.\n13.7 DataFortress’ liability for loss of data is limited to the typical recovery effort that could not have been avoided even if the customer had made regular and risk-appropriate backup copies.\nsubcontractors, third party products DataFortress may use subcontractors for the provision of the services owed. In doing so, DataFortress ensures that the service provision in the area of hosting is carried out from Germany. 15 Confidentiality 15.1 The Customer is obligated to keep confidential all information about DataFortress that has become known to him or becomes known to him in connection with this contract and that is marked as confidential or is classified as business and trade secrets on the basis of other circumstances (e.g. conception and implementation of the programming carried out by DataFortress and other technical and technological know-how of DataFortress, hereinafter referred to as “Confidential Information”), to keep it permanently secret, not to disclose it to third parties, to record it or to use it in any other way, unless DataFortress has expressly consented in writing to its disclosure or use or the information is required to be disclosed by law, court order or administrative decision.\n15.2 Insofar as relevant, the Customer shall ensure by means of suitable contractual agreements with its employees and all other persons working for it that these persons also refrain from any disclosure, utilization, disclosure or recording of the Confidential Information.\n15.3 The information shall not be Confidential Information within the meaning of this Section 15 if it was\nwas already known to the Customer beforehand without the information having been subject to a confidentiality obligation, is generally known or becomes known without a breach of the confidentiality obligations assumed, is disclosed to the Customer by a third party without breach of a confidentiality obligation. 15.4 If the Customer violates any of the obligations set forth in this clause, DataFortress may terminate the contract extraordinarily.

Furthermore, DataFortress is allowed to publish press releases about the client’s order and the project.\ndata protection 17.1 Insofar as DataFortress collects, processes and uses personal data from the sphere of the Customer in the course of initiating, establishing and executing the contract, this shall be done in accordance with the applicable statutory provisions on data protection, and in particular only within the scope of the purpose of the contract.\n17.2 The Customer shall not process any personal data on IT systems for which DataFortress is technically responsible. If the Customer commissions DataFortress with services in the context of which it cannot be excluded that DataFortress comes into contact with personal data for which the Customer is responsible, a commissioned data processing agreement shall be concluded.\n18 Term, Termination 18.1 Unless otherwise agreed for individual services, the minimum term of the contract shall be 24 months after signing of the contract. The term shall be extended by a further twelve months in each case if the contract is not terminated in writing after expiry of the minimum contract term with six months’ notice to the end of the month.\n18.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated in writing by either party in the event of a sustained breach of material contractual obligations by the other party if, despite written warning by the other party, such party fails to comply with the Agreement even after a reasonable period of time and the terminating party cannot reasonably be expected to continue the respective contractual relationship until the ordinary termination as set forth above takes effect.\n18.3 The right to extraordinary termination shall remain unaffected.\n19 Termination and settlement 19.1 In the event of a complete or partial termination of this agreement, DataFortress is obligated to surrender to the Customer or to destroy at the Customer’s request all data, documents and materials in its possession which contain business, organizational or technical data or information from or about the Customer, unless statutory retention periods conflict with this, unless the data, documents, etc. to be surrendered or destroyed are the intellectual property of DataFortress or are still required by DataFortress for the further processing of the agreement.\n19.2 At the Customer’s request, DataFortress shall provide all services required for the transfer of the contractual services to the Customer or a third party designated by the Customer (e.g. migration to another IT system, provision of appropriately qualified employees, performance of training) for a period of up to twelve (12) months after termination of the Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the “Transition Period”). DataFortress shall work closely with the Customer and the third party designated by the Customer to ensure that no disruptions in the provision of services occur during the Transition Period and that the Customer or the third party designated by the Customer is able to commence operation of the contractual services after the date of termination of the Agreement. In this respect, DataFortress is also obligated to prepare and provide appropriate documentation. The Customer shall cooperate in this regard.\n19.3 DataFortress’s claim to remuneration for the monthly fee as well as all other costs shall remain in effect until the final shutdown of the systems. In individual cases, a reduction of the calendar monthly remuneration, the agreed availability levels and the warranty conditions may be agreed for this period.\n19.4 Upon receipt of written notification that the Customer has been able to read and process all transferred data, the data will be deleted from the systems in DataFortress’ data center and the Customer will be notified of this deletion in writing.\nnon-solicitation Customer agrees to refrain from employing or soliciting or attempting to employ or solicit any employee employed or otherwise engaged by DataFortress for the duration of this Agreement. 21 Miscellaneous 21.1 The place of performance of all obligations under the respective contract shall be the place of business of DataFortress if the Customer is a merchant within the meaning of the German Commercial Code (HGB), a legal entity under public law or a special fund under public law.\n21.2 The law of the Federal Republic of Germany shall apply exclusively to the contract.
